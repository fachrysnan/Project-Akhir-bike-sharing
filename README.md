## Analysis with jupyter notebook
A final project from Dicoding in the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course, we have to make analysis and create a dashboard from the the three datas which has been provided. In the notebook file, we need to make the analysis from Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, to Data Visualization. You can check the analysis here: [notebook](https://github.com/fachrysnan/Project-Akhir-bike-sharing/blob/af9f3b884e0b67b4df595050eb8c229c0abd3541/notebook.ipynb)
## Run Streamlit on Local
